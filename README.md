# üåç SkyGrid App  

**SkyGrid** is an **AI-powered Android application** that integrates **geospatial APIs** for  
**Flood Detection**, üõ∞Ô∏è **Object Recognition**, and **Land Analysis** using **satellite imagery**.  
Designed for **smart disaster management, environmental monitoring, and land-use planning**.  

---

## Features
- **Flood Analysis** ‚Äì Detect and visualize flood-affected areas using geospatial flood datasets.  
- **Object Recognition** ‚Äì Identify objects (buildings, vehicles, infrastructure) from aerial/satellite images.  
- **Land Analysis** ‚Äì Classify land cover, vegetation, and urban expansion for better planning.    
- **User-Friendly Android App** ‚Äì Lightweight, responsive, and designed for both offline & online use.

## Tech Stack
**Frontend (App)**  
- Android (Java/Kotlin)  
- Retrofit (API client)  
- Material UI  

**Backend / AI Integration**  
- FastAPI (Python)  
- PyTorch / TensorFlow (AI models)  
- Hugging Face Models (e.g., Prithvi Flood Segmentation, Object Detection APIs)  

**Data & APIs**  
- **Satellite Imagery** (Sentinel, Landsat, UAV data)  
- **Flood APIs** ‚Äì Sen1Floods11 / Prithvi Flood Model  
- **Land APIs** ‚Äì Land cover classification datasets  
- **Object Detection APIs** ‚Äì Pre-trained object recognition models

##  Implementation Procedure
1. **Setup Android Project**  
   - Create Android Studio project  
   - Add Retrofit for API communication  
   - Configure permissions for internet & storage  

2. **Integrate APIs**  
   - Connect **Flood Detection API** for analyzing flooded regions  
   - Use **Land Cover API** for land classification  
   - Connect **Object Detection API** for identifying infrastructure & resources  

3. **Backend (FastAPI)**  
   - Build REST APIs to handle image upload & processing  
   - Load AI models (flood segmentation, land classification, object detection)  
   - Send processed results to the Android app
